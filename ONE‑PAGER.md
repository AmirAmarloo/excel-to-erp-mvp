Problem
Companies receive Excel files every day from branches, suppliers, customers, and internal teams.
These files often contain mistakes: missing values, wrong formats, inconsistent entries, duplicated records, or data that simply doesn’t follow business rules.
These issues lead to delays, rework, incorrect postings in the ERP, and hidden operational costs for finance and operations teams.

Why Excel validation fails
Excel can only catch very simple mistakes.
It cannot understand business rules, cannot detect duplicates across files, and users can easily bypass its built‑in checks.
Most importantly, Excel does not provide a clear, structured error report — leaving finance teams to manually search for problems row by row.

What DataBridge does
DataBridge reviews Excel files before they enter the ERP.
It identifies all issues, explains what is wrong, and produces a clean, corrected version of the file that is ready for import.
DataBridge prevents bad data from entering the system, reduces manual work, and ensures that financial and operational data is accurate from the start.

What DataBridge does NOT do
DataBridge is not an ERP system.
It does not store business data, generate financial reports, or replace existing workflows.
It does not change how your ERP works — it simply ensures that the data entering it is clean, consistent, and reliable.

Who it is for
- Finance managers
- ERP managers
- Accounting teams
- Operations teams
- Any organization that regularly imports Excel files into an ERP or financial system
DataBridge is designed for teams that want fewer errors, less manual cleanup, and more reliable data — without changing their existing systems.
